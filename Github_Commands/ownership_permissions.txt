file ownership refers to the concept that every file and directory is associated to a specific 
user and group while file modes are the permissions assigned to files and directories that control
how users can interact with the files. These permissions are granted to the owner, group and others. 
The three types of permissions are read(r), write(w) and execute(x). Permissions can be modified using the 
"chmod" command with symbols (+, -, =) or numbers.
